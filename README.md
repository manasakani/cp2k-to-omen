# omen_preprocessing

(Fix this readme later)

This was written to be a minimally-functioning version of the MATLAB scripts used to create the hamiltonian, overlap matrix, and other text files specifying
device parameters which the OMEN code expects to find in the input folder. It was written to be used for metal-oxide-metal devices in which the atomic
structure of the entire device is fully specified by the coordinates in the input xyz file.
